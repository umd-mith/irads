Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also\nserves as the Chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission\nand is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington\nUniversity. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be\nappointed as a Chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official\ndocuments, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part\nSwedish, Czech, and German with \"traces\" of Native American heritage.\n\nWe see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black\norganization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In\nthe Dolezal\u2019s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated\nfraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community\nin order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.\n\nWe need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal\u2019s activities while she was a\npresident of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to\nrepeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by\nblack community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police\ndepartments and authorities of Cities with a predominantly black population!\n\n",

Yeah, it is all started from the government\u2019s attitude\ntowards Blacks. But let\u2019s remember Tupac and his ability to question the\nsocial order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to Change\ntheir lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each\nother and to learn to love each other.\n\n",

It was an advertised on social 200 teenager\u2019s pool party which\nended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of\nthe five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager CIanton passed away on the\nway to hospital.\n\nIn fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident.\nWhy the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware\nof a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black\nteenager dies?\n\nUnfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the\ntragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the\neasiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the\nshootings at the average pool party.\n\n",

However it doesn\u2019t give the reason to taser a\n\nchild.\n\nWe see another case of police misconduct, when the policeman actually\nattacked the Child. This case should reach the court, because the Child hasn\u2019t\ndone anything unlawful. The policeman exceeded his powers and used force\nagainst a Child. So he should be punished. Before the trial nothing's gonna\nChange and cops are about to do whatever they want.

Why the flag that represents the\nmurder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse?\n\nThe confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery\ntime, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask\nto remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nYes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of\nAmerica including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.\nWe must give new names to the streets which were named after racist\npolitical figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to\nAndrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned\nslaves on their farms.\n\nHow can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show\nourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?\n\n",

It's in every state around the country. The\nyoung girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police,\ngood police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need\nsomeone who will protect us from the police.

West criticized Obama as \"a person who is afraid and intimidated when\nit comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.\"\n\n\"A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and\nintimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and\nfighting against white supremacy,\" West explained. \"So when many of us said\nwe have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with\n\nracism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president\nof all America, not just black America.\u2018 We know he's president of all America\n\nbut white supremacy is American as Cherry pie.\"\n\nWest is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and\n2012 instead of Obama. But we had no Choice. Cornel is a good leader, he\nknows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big\ncorporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks\nfrom police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just\ncount how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The\nnumber is horrific.\n\n",

It will allow to increase a number of votes for a\nDemocratic Party presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nAnd democrats don\u2019t care about the fact that most of immigrants will become\nwelfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn\u2019t need\nimmigrants, democrats do. What\u2019s more important: to win Presidential\nelections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to Choose first\noption.

Let\u2019s take a look at just how crazy\nthis pledge gets.\n\nThat\u2019s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional\namendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last\ndecade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55\npercent!\n\nBut they don\u2019t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to \u201cwork to overturn\nany Supreme Court decision\u201d in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants\nthe president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at\nthis point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that\nsupporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn\u2019t qualified to be a judge.\n\nAlso, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating\nloopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious\njustification. That could actually happen \u2014 and it already has in some states \u2014\nso it\u2019s a huge concern.\n\nAnd fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment\nagainst people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are\nharassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated\nfrom theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there\u2019ll be NO MORE of it!\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM\u2019s fanatics. When they\nfinally kick the bucket, they\u2019ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly\nface it or not) that their Life\u2019s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they\nworked for made anyone\u2019s life better. At all.\n\nThey didn\u2019t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.\nAnd when they\u2019re dead and gone, they\u2019ll be remembered only as footnotes\nin shameful history \u2014 or more likely they \u2018ll be forgotten completely.\n\n#LGBT #NOM #SameSexMarriage #Marriage #SCOTUS #equality\n",

The proposal reminds me\nthe Inquisition. We live in a free and tolerate country! So even talks about\nsuch an initiative should be immediately stopped. Where is our President?\nStop considering gays as naughty and not like all the others. We are all equal.\nDespite all the arguments that the opponents of gay marriage call, polls show\nthat the majority of Americans stand for gay marriages. Why not to hold a\nreferendum as the Irish did? Why we should listen to conservatives?\n\n",

It is\nthe biggest mistake!\n\nWhen students perceive that they\u2019re not supposed to talk about\nhomosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about\nbeing gay. And it\u2019s a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and\nharassment.\n\nGay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It\u2019s very powerful both for\nstraight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and\npeople they respect who are LGBT and who are good at theirjobs. It\u2019s\nimportant for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be\nillegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual\nor perceived sexual orientation!\n\n",

I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my\nstory could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it\nalways gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become\nsomeone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves!\n\nEver since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn\u2019t like any of the other\nkids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something\nI still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and\nSuperman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies... I\nwanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these\ndolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew\nboys weren\u2019t supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by\n\nmy grandmother\u2019s ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop\nbeing a sissy...\"\n\nPlease spend 5 minutes to read this letter... it is very important just to be\nhead\u201d.\n\nThank you for your brave act! You are a true hero!\n\nPlease share your stories and photos... Inspire us and others!\n",

    "text": "Homophobic nurse tries to discourage birth mom from allowing gay couple to\nadopt child\n\nWhile the birth mother was resting with the baby, Andy and his partner took a\nbreak from the hospital to get some food. When they returned, they had a\nflurry of phone messages from the mother, crying and urging them to get back\nsoon. A nurse had been questioning her about her decision to let a gay\ncouple adopt her baby.\n\n\u201dAren\u2019t you afraid those boys are gonna hurt that baby? Aren\u2019t you afraid\n\nthat he\u2019s not gonna grow up and be normal?\u201d asked the nurse.\n\nExcuse me who the hell is she?! This bigot is forcing her views onto the\nmother, because she doesn't think the baby would grow up \"normal\"? A\nmother who's making the difficult decision to place her son up for adoption,\nand a wonderful couple who wants to raise that child. What the hell right does\nthe nurse have to try to stop that? I hope they fire her.\n\nI'm happy for the Gay couple on becoming parents!\n",

For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was\ntrained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was\ntold that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat\nto you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.\n\nWhat does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,\nimproper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.\nThat\u2018s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black\nmen fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in\nAmerica. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed\npeople of color killed by police.\n\nHow dangerous is to live in your area today?\n",

The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that\nplague black women every day.\n\n\u201cBlack features are beautiful, black women are hot,\u201d Stenberg wrote. \u201cWhite\nwomen are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of\nfetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding\nblack femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty\nstandards.\u201d\n\nEverybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all\nthe news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair\nsentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are\nbeing abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for\nthemselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.\n\nIn modern America black women experience more depression than probably\nduring slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden\nbehind the mask of tolerance.\n\n",

Not seven\nyears ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.\n\nThis time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an\nofficer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing\ncomplex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police\nencountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen\npistol.\n\nHis mother said that she respected the police and that her son \u201cshouldn\u2019t\nhave had the gun.\u201d But from what witnesses have told her, she said, \u201cThey\ndidn\u2019t have to shoot him down like that.\u201d\n\nOne of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did\nhave a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at\nanyone as he tried to run from officers.\n\nWhen a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a\nblack guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun) - he'll be immediately shot by\nthe police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then\nhere we go. Racial prejudice at its finest.\n\nOur condolences to the family.\n",

The\nsystem needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,\nthe biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or\ndisorderly conduct.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit\nwith summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what\nshould we do?\n\nThe criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it\nis now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep\npeople in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a\nbusiness.\n\nThe first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government\nwill start to sell indulgences soon.\n\nOur system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative\nsolutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and\npotentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!\n\nLemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives\ngo to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other\nPresidents administrations were brought to justice.\n\nAmerica has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a\nmeans to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping\nthe very rich from ever being brought to justice.\n\n",

He preferred to find a we||-|it area\nto pull over in. As a result, he was Charged with \u2018fleeing\u2019 police.\n\nPeople are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to\ncommunicate with officers only in the we||-|it areas. And get Charged for that.\nSometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military\noperations in the foreign countries, our country\u2019s at war with its own Citizens\nwith the help of police.\n\n",

Amari Brown, a 7-year-old\nboy on the City's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities.\n\nThose 30 shootings came between 9:20 pm Saturday and 4:45 am. Sunday.\nAmari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and\ndown the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other\nrelatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire\noutside a relative's home where Amari and other Children were playing, hitting\nboth the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the Chest.\n\nNo arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference\nSunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in.\n\nHow can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every\nAmerican like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body?\nHe just played with his friends outdoor. |s human life really worth nothing in\nour country?\n\nRest in peace, Amari Brown.\n",

The US\nHomeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting\ntoo many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps\nnew terrorist attacks won\u2019t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more\nterrorist attacks if the immigration policy won\u2019t be tightened.\n\nWe have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from\nthe government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism,\nlaw enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for\nrefugees if not all US Citizens live normally?\n\n",

    "text": "The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base,\nwhich contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The\nfigure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration\u2014meaning the\ntotal number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would\nactually be larger than 1.24 million.\n\nOf course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had\nhuge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today\nthere is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is\na reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate\nfuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low\nwages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.\nThose who work illegaly don\u2019t pay taxes that are an important part of state\n\nbudget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions\nincreases crime rates.\n\nMoreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of\npeople in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a\nreport of the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nYou see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates\nsocial and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen\nthe US. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can\u2019t be the Tower of\nBabel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We\ndon\u2019t hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the\nworld, but we cannot allow them to stay here.\n\nIt\u2019s the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous\nproblems for the nation.\n\n",

Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is\nconducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a\nfundamental Islamist.

It is noteworthy that in his\nletter the terrorist didn\u2019t refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own\nvolition.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam\nhave place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the\nMiddle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to\nbecome radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on\ntheir own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more\nseriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam,\naccording to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live\ncomfortable together.

President Obama hasn\u2019t ordered to lower\na flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon\nthe deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or\nher state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By\ncontrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that\nas the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered\nto haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,\n\nthe shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of\nNelson Mandela. But it hasn\u2019t yet been lowered in honor of the service\n\nmembers murdered in Tennessee.\n\nBy doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen\nsoldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not\n\ndeserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is\nnecessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as\nmeat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist\nattack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then\ndecided to kill in the name of Allah.\n\nIn general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many\nways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do\n\nnot even bother to learn English, because it\u2019s enough to speak Spanish, has\nincreased.\n\n",

He has been\ndiscriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.\n\nThere's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change\nthe gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.\n\nBut many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical\nreasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these\npeople\u2019s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.\n\nIt is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\\her\nidentification to reflect who they really are. It\u2019s not just about person dressed\nas a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is\nabout much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man\nor woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they\nwere assigned to at birth.\n\nTransgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification\nChanges. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.\nBecause it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you\nwere assigned to at birth.\n\nPlease share your stories with us, because united we can stand against\ninjustice and inequality!\n\n#Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination\n",

And\nit is becoming dangerous.\n\nSo, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the\nConfederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the\nfamily was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their\nown driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the\ndriveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.\n\n\u201cHe slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a\ngun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn\u2019t worth anything now,\u201d\nMark Wilson said.\n\nWhen one spits upon the law because he thinks that it\u2019s amoral, it is\nbeginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery\nwas in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don\u2019t want to understand that\nslavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a\nflag of England or France.\n\nActivists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and\nmonuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at\nStone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even\ndemanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political\ncorrectness because George Washington owned slaves.\n\nLiberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans\nshould be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If\nsomebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to\neliminate the party.\n\nContinue to stay for the First amendment! Let\u2019s stop the Chaos!\n",

I\u2019m gay.\u201d For many\nparents first reaction probably will be \u201cHow will I ever handle this?\u201d The\nanswer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help\nto understand your Child\u2019s sexuality and its meaning to you and your\ncontinued relationship with your son or daughter.\n\nSome parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their\nChild\u2019s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as\nproblem-free \u2014 overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during\nthat time.\n\nSometimes parents try to deny what is happening \u2014 by rejecting what they're\nhearing (\u201cIt\u2019s just a phase; you\u2019ll get over it\u201d); by shutting down (\u201cIf you\nChoose that lifestyle, I don\u2019t want to hear about it\u201d); or by not registering the\nimpact of what we\u2019re being told (\u201cThat\u2019s nice, dear, and what do you want\n\nfor dinner?\u201d).\n\nSuch denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If\nyou as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child\u2019s sexuality, you\nwould never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept\nsecret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.\n\nIt is important to accept and understand your child\u2019s sexuality because\nhomosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment\nfor some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of\ntelling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\".\n\nOn the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding\nand acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you\u2019re wondering, \u201cls\nshe/he sure?\u201d the answer will almost always be \u201cyes\u201d!\n\nDON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET!\n\n#Children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #oomingout #aoceptance\n",

Just over a week before his\ndeath, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.\n\nOfficers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports\nthat a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the\nlot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the\ndealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,\nArlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when\ntold to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer\nBrad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation\nbroke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of\nMiller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.\n\nAnd now there are three main points that you should think of:\n\n1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo\nState University. Never was involved in criminal activities.\n\n2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and\nwas working under the supervision of a training officer.\n\n3) Taylor didn't want to die young.\n\nBlack teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one\n\nto save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want\nour kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes\n\ndoomed to disappointment?\n",

Therefore it endangers\nthe rights of black community.\n\nDoubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black\nmen, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America\nwould spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the\ndomestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.\n\n",

This confirms that the government\u2019s\nslapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans\nwithout medical assistance.

After national debate over the\nrelationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad\ncop, who killed innocent black Child\" tried to go back to police work but was\nturned down because he's too big a liability.\n\nIn the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue,\nso it makes me unemployable.\"\n\nSo what does the situation mean to America?\n\nAlmost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had\nthe audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.\nMichael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed\nhim. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He\nmust stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how\nupside-down society has become.\n\nI wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will\nsurgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send\nteachers to jail for teaching?\n\nInstead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots\nturned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America?\n\n",

Just like Wonder Woman using her\nsuperpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)\n\n#wonderwoman #superheroes #marriageequality #gaymarriage #Iesbian\n",

What a hypocrite!\n\nAnd she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her\nreligious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's\nher role only to enact it!\n\nFunny how all these \"Christians\" are preaching and practicing all this hate,\neh?\n\nIf Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, \"What the hell\nis wrong with you people!\"\n\n#SameSexMarriage #MarriageEquality #Kentucky #SCOTUS #homophobia\n#bigotry\n\n",

The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell, who had a severe mental illness had\nbeen ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a\nzebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,\nVirginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.\n\nAjudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been\ntransported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there\nwasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in\nhis cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a\nmental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to\neat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health\ncrisis.\n\nYes, you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is\njust an empty word in this country. Be sure, you will never know the truth. We\nare far away from the truth.\n\n",

Had the situation been reversed,\nhowever, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for\ndeclining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.\n\nA man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,\nallegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers\nresponded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed\nConerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to\nintervene.\n\nBystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid \u201cwas\nreasonable under the Circumstances,\u201d but the burden of demonstrating that\nthis is the case is placed upon the accused.\n\nWhen you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that\nyou can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime.\n\n",

And now they Claim enourmous victory.\n\nUnder the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the\n\nSenate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect \u2014 a legally binding long-\nterm agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of\ndollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.\n\nSince this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been\nobliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can\nnever get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in\n2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and\nthe Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.\n\nBut Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a\nsubject to a vote \u2014 not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be\ntreated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and\nthe Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his\npresidential veto.\n\nThe Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to\noverturn such a veto \u2014 and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,\ninstead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67\nsenators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or\nmore Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to\nsupport the deal.\n\nThus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will\nsimply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking\nand obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42\npercent.\n\nBarack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn\u2019t care\nabout Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.\n\n",

He reveals his\nsexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to Chat him up.\nChuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: \"I don\u2019t think his\nsexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it\u2019s part of who\nhe is.\n\nIsn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the\ncreators of the new \"Star Wars\" for the incredible courage and opposition to\nconservative bias in Hollywood Cinema. There should be a special\norganization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There\nshould be at least one gay Character in every movie in order to help the\nAmerican society get rid of homophobic stereotypes.\n\n",

    "text": "The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan,\nannounced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on\nOctober 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the\nMillion Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,\nLatinos and incarcerated.\n\nThey say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among\nradical groups. Only black activists say \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, forgetting the fact\nthatjustice is when all lives matter.\n\nAmericans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the\nlaw, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes\nover the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the\nimmigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should\nbe imprisoned.\n\nGiven the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in\nFerguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan\u2019s\nbenevolent intentions.\n\nThis Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim\ncommunities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent\nnews about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal\nRobert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on\nAmerican extremists to execute him.\n\nThere is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he\nshould live here legally; he should not break the law. lt\u2019s justice.\n\n",

    "text": "Why | March! #JusticeOrElse\n\n20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and Children gathered on the\nNational Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis\nFarrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers\nand unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years\nlater, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice\nsystem once and for all.\n\n| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than\nthere were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local\nprosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is\nan officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that\ndisproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white\npeople use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry\noff the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't\nvideo record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that\ncriminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before\nthey even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on\nincidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a\nsystem that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.\nTo fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school\ndiscipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that\ntargets communities of color by programs like \"Stop & Frisk\" or \"Broken\nWindows.\"\n\nThis is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better\nfuture for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.\n\nLike and share if you want to help the movement!\n",

    "text": "Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead\n\nTen people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a\nsmall community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in\nClassrooms in Snyder Hall.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man\nresponsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three\nhandguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a\nfight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.\n\nOne of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people\u2019s\nreligions before he began firing.\n\nThe hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,\nand quoted a doctor who said that an \"army\" of doctors and nurses had\nvolunteered to help.\n\nIt's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is\nthe only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few\nmonths. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn\u2019t it time for some\ngun control yet?\n\nSome white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported\nBLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This\ndude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a\nfew hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's\nwhite. And honestly, word \"shooting\" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it\nterror? Oh, wait. White male though...\n\n#UCC #Oregon #shooting\n",

In fact, I see all good things in the United States, and\nI\u2019m proud to be an American. But I reckon that I can\u2019t have the right to keep\nsilence when outrageous things happen.\n\nI can\u2019t keep silence while stupid idiots forbid our Children to wear patriotic\nClothes. I can\u2019t keep silence while Obama creates comfortable conditions for\nterrorists, accepting of 10,000 Syrian refugees. I can\u2019t keep silence while\nliberals spit on the US. Constitution.\n\nYes, | criticize everything what is unacceptable for the nation. If Americans\nturn a blind eye to outrageous things, enjoying only positive moments of their\nlives, we will never live better. Criticism is a way for development. I\u2019m a\npatriot, that\u2019s why I criticize.\n\n",

Fredrick\nDouglas said \u201c Power concedes nothing except by a demand\u201d. Our demand\nof government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the\nbrotherhood.\n\nIt's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.\n\nJoin the Movement! 10-10-15\nJustice Or Else!\n\n",

    "text": "This military campaign is very ambiguous given that it has cost nearly 2,500\nAmerican lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to \"disrupt\nthe use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations.\" Well, the\nintervention deprived aI-Qaida of a sanctuary. But aI-Qaida \u2014 even after its\nleader Osama bin Laden was killed by US. commandos \u2014 has spawned cells\nelsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is\nrising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question\nis whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the\nmission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should\nreview his military strategy without delay.Joih us! Veterans USA ( @veterans\nGovSpending\n\n",

It\nis well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.\nYet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all\nthese SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black\nsoldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white\nsoldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.\nAlmost a twofold difference!

    "text": "Police Officer Robert Rialmo\u2019s attorney, Joel Brodsky, says that he will be\nfiling a counterclaim against the estate of Quintonio LeGrier on the grounds of\nassault and emotional distress. This is how it looks like when A White Police\nkills a black Civiliian, and also feels it\u2019s his right to sue the dead because\nsympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio\nLeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops,\nthen we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always\nrewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and\nsegregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of\ninhumanity. The cops still things it wasn\u2019t enough killing a mentally\ndisordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the\ndead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black.\n\n",

The filming was still in process as he\ncommanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately\nended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a Chance to get into position\nwhen he opened fire. It\u2019s quite not understandable why his own cop shot him\nand shot the mentality i|| man too.

Four other larger prisons will be built\nadditionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd.

Most people are jailed because one way or the other\nthere was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even\nthough they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a\ngold mine, extracting huge sum of money from Civilians. You can be put\nbehind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one\u2019s life\nbecomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making\na better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all\nthese people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums\nof money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn\u2019t pay a fine.\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nSubscribe to my YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChannellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Williams8kalvin\n",

The filming was still in process as he\ncommanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately\nended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a Chance to get into position\nwhen he opened fire. It\u2019s quite not understandable why his own cop shot him\nand shot the mentality i|| man too.

Hillary described him as a man of \u201csurpassing eloquence and\nnobility\u201d. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying \u201cIt is\nalmost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.\nHe was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its\nhistorian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he\nwas always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless\nadvocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the\nConstitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a\ngovernment that improves the lives of the people it serves.\u201d\n\nSo here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate\ncan\u2019t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show\nher respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.\nIsn\u2019t that a little hypocritical?\n\n",

    "text": "An Open Letter to Hillary Clinton:\n\nDear Mrs. Clinton,\n\nWe are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the\n\nrise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our\nvoices be heard.\n\nWe know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential\ncampaign, but did you support us before campaign?\n\nWe didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and\nAmericans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused\nhundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their\nhomes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women\nand Children, to die in their homes, and for what?\n\nLibya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-\nGaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not\nforget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,\nand that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens\nand US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and\nCIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were\nalso injured in the attacks.\n\nYou killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the\ncountries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat\nnot only to the US. but the whole world!\n\nYou are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the\nsame time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,\ncreating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,\nAfghanistan and Syria.\n\n8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years\nago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change\nyour views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,\nbut you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United\nStates.\n\nSincerely,\nUnited Muslims of America\n\n",

THINGS\nHAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF\n\nThe 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he\nhad a \u201cmedical episode\u201d at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark\nfrom one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was\ntoo combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.\n\nOn February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting\nthat Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,\nwas threatening to kill him and his son. Clark\u2018s wife said that a man and his\nson began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he\nhadn\u2018t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken\nto the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his\ncombative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some\nbreathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour\nlater he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nAn investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail\ninmate.\n\nNow the question is whether the jail\u2018s standard operating procedures were\nfollowed.\n\nWe would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \u201cfighting\u201d with\nthe police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at\nhospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in\npolice custody.\n\n",

For instance, police trooper\nHa|| received a \u201cneed improvement rating,\u201d his squad car was taken away,\nand his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police\ntrooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended\non the basis of race.\n\nOnce again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers\nstill remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police\ndepartment despite the fact that we live in a \u201cpost-racial\u201d society.\n\n",

Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-\nMurphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and\ndemanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,\nLopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor\nBrown, who was beat and pepper\u2014sprayed by police. Brown is not the only\nvictim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.\n\nThe US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why\nthe hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held\npersonally and financially responsible for their actions.\n\nCould you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat\nzone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another\nattitude to people in blue?\n\n",

Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.\nCould you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she\nrealized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face\nis priceless.\n\nThe story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for\nillegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who\nhad towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The\ndriver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under\nthreat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11\nyears and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that\nhow PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix\nthe situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer\nis to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not\nhave mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.\n\nTo my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.\nSuch cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give\nour Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.\n\nFor more stories, join our new brand site http://donotshoot.us/\n",

Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

They believe it is justifiable to shoot\nsomeone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their\neyes.\n\nIt will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the\ndifference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will\nget away with it.\n\nIn comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand\nthat theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,\nthey understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.\n\nBad that America trained not like this!???\n",

Cops hold man down and sic K\u20149 on him for dancing in a\nparking lot\n\nThe City will pay Linson Tara $100,000 to settle a CiviI-rights lawsuit filed after\nthe Washington cops used Tasers, their fists and then a police dog on him\nwhile he was being restrained. Only 100k? Seriously? Guys, don't you think\nit's not enough for a man who was choked, tased, punched in the face several\ntimes while the dog bit you? It should be more zeroes in the number.\n\nA dash cam video showed one of the officers holding Tara on the hood of the\npolice cruiser while his partner used a Taser on him. IS THAT THE WAY YOU\nWANT POLICE TO TREAT US? The video gives us a great explanation of the\nquestion, why do people hate cops?\n\nDear Americans, we've got to understand a simple idea - nothing will Change\nunless you, me and the whole country start taking judgments out of THEIR\npaychecks... and then you'll see this behavior stop.\n\n",

Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the\nCIinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront\na very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the\nDemocrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy\nAmerica just to be elected.\n\nWe have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal\nimmigration around the whole country! Let's flood the United States with\nAmerican flags!\n\nIf you have a desire to organize a rally in your City, please contact us. We can\nhelp you. Only our patriotism can save the United States of America!\n\n",

Illegal aliens affect our economy drastically.\nNot only they sink the job market and steal hundreds of millions of welfare\ndollars, they also flood America with drugs, which is the worst. Mexican\ncartels have a stable stream of drugs through the border and our government\ndoes nothing with it.\n\nTo cure our nation we need to get rid of all the gangs and illegal immigrants\nand build a huge wall so they would never come back!\n\n",

    "text": "All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret\ngay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even\nif it\u2019s evident. There\u2019s a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or\njust know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But\nif you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your\nsecrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other\ncops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the\nmisconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally\nwithholding the information about officer misconduct were upper\nadministrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly\nenough, \u201cSworn officer of the court\u201d is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is\neven accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code\nof silence, and it\u2019s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.\n\nSubscribe to our Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChannellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.oom/Williams8kalvin\n",

These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

Cooke is a law student, so she knows her rights. When she\nrefused to consent to search, she was told to wait for a K\u20149 unit to arrive\nbefore she could leave.\n\nCooke didn\u2019t commit any crime, that\u2019s why she wanted to leave, but officers\nhad the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and\nthe female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for\nseveral seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck\nand searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in\nhandcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg\nbefore she could go home.\n\nThis girl\u2019s day was totally ruined because cops thought that she looked\nsuspicious. After they ILLEGALLY searched her vehicle, she couldn\u2019t go.\n\nThis is what real terrorism looks like!\n",

In popular\nculture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came\nto speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things\nunrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.\n\nHe risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.\nFurthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was\naccused of committing a felony.\n\nNow that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot\nbe filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!\n\n",

Over\nthe course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,\neight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5\nmillion in cash, according to a press release. \u201cIt would be safe to say that the\nmoney would be taken back to Mexico, and that\u2019s where the source of the\ncocaine was,\u201d special agent Tim Stone said.\n\nThis is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which\nmakes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to\nprevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The\nmost part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as\nunprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as\nthey can.\n\nAt the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government\nofficials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get\nfilthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.\n\nOnly a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only\nhope for a better future!\n\n",

I appreciate the way he maintains his independent\nopinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic\noption\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than\nan \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'\nmoney!\n\nHillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like\nSaudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that\nabuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged\nfeminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries\nthat prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary\nhas always been a \"defender\" of the minorities.\n\nSo, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.\nWhat's your opinion on that point?\n\n",

But Obama's speech did not make sense at all. That's why we\nhave to support all police officers who refused to applaud Obama.\n\nTaking sides with these rioters and racists, Obama literally called for open war\nagainst police officers and whites. He came there and he lectured officers\nwho are targeted every day for assassination by Black Lives Matter that they\nneed to Change. Kick this asshole out of Texas!\n\n",

These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

Notice the\nlocation of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on\n\nthe passenger's side.\n\nWhen Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the\nsituation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man\nbriefly lying unconscious on the ground.\n\nThe beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows\nthat he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?\nDamn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO\nPOLICE! The following video is a prime example of why...\n\n",

I appreciate the way he maintains his independent\nopinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic\noption\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than\nan \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'\nmoney!\n\nHillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like\nSaudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that\nabuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged\nfeminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries\nthat prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary\nhas always been a \"defender\" of the minorities.\n\nSo, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.\nWhat's your opinion on that point?\n\n",

Another arrest was carried\nout the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protesters were\narrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July\n7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have\nbeen embarking on demonstration outside the governor\u2019s home but police\nofficers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are\nblocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the\nprotesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors\nare welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.\nEven though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters\nhave returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.\n\nSubscribe to our Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChahnellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Williams8kalvih\n",

Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back \u2014 for the\nsecond time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.\nIt is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led\nto the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.\n\nSubscribe to our Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/ChahnellUCszPCwUDPvDCR6VRaOCDtg\n\nFollow my Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsandKalvin\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.oom/Williams8kalvih\n",

Now, it is\nthe time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.\nThe war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black\ncommunity has forgotten.

They believe they are\njudge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,\n\nit is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot\nsomeone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their\n\neyes.\n\nIt will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the\ndifference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will\n\nget away with it.\n\nIn comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand\nthat theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,\nthey understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.\n\nBad that America trained not like this!???\n",

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge\npolice brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the\ngovernment and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party\n\"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to Close\nit, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was\ndissolved.\n\n50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country\nstills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country\nlike the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We\nneed a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that\ncan make Black Lives really matter.\n\nLet's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has\nmade the Change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their\nideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary\n\n",

    "text": "On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP.\nTheir idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the Change, we must take\naction. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge\npolice brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the\ngovernment and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party\n\"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to Close\nit, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was\ndissolved.\n\n50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country\nstills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country\nlike the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We\nneed a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that\ncan make Black Lives really matter.\n\nLet's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has\nmade the Change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their\nideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary\n\n",

October 22nd is a day that people\naround the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of\nProtest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a\nGeneration.\n\nHere in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims\nand quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-\nknown case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was\nshot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,\nwho just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.\n\nWe need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police\nrepresentatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and\nserve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!\n\nJoin us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between\nCharlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.

The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but\nthey are wrong. We won\u2019t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does\nnot talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it\nmention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some\noutdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a\nvictory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.\nWe are free citizens of Texas and we\u2019ve had enough of this Cheap show on\nthe screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and\ngun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but\nnot without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher\ntaxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist\nattacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let\u2019s remind them\nwhat Texas is made of and show that we\u2019re ready to SECEDE!\n\nUse our page to team up with other locals.

However, most of these\nathletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10,\nafter getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the\nBeaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,\nthe students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive\nboard decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season\nand canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition\nmight face in this country.\n\n",

And here are\nsome real Clinton decisions:\n\n\u2014Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had\nbeen exaggerated by Republicans.\n\n\u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007\nsupplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans\u2019\n\nmedical care.\n-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20\n\nmillion for veterans\u2019 health care facilities.\n-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for \u201c$13 billion\nfor veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the\npoor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the\nissue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they\nneed so bad!\n\nHardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a\ndirect threat to the American veterans\u2019 society, but still practically no one\nraises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!\n\n",

It\u2019s only coming and the consequences will be\ndestructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the\nPresident of the United States.\n\nDefending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of\nevery American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American\nnational identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments\nliberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.\n\nDemocrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist\nmovements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse\nracism, against those who want to destroy America!\n\nAmong all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend\nthe police from terrorists.\n\n",

When | tell you to\ndo something, you do it, boy.\u201d\n\nAfter the Burleson County Sheriff\u2018s Office launched an investigation, a\n\u201cbehavior specialist\u201d who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young\nstudent was fired.\n\nThe school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the\nstudents. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who\nabuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child\nshould be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on\nadministrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.\n\n",

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge\npolice brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the\ngovernment and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party\n\"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to Close\nit, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was\ndissolved.\n\n50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country\nstills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country\nlike the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We\nneed a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that\ncan make Black Lives really matter.\n\nLet's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has\nmade the Change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their\nideas and ideals! Black Panther Party 50th Anniversary\n\n",

The\n12-year-old was carrying a toy airsoft gun when officer Timothy Loehmann\nshot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not\nindict the killer.\n\nTamir\u2019s mother said she is \u201cmad as hell\u201d with the grand jury\u2019s decision of\ndeclaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, \u201cHe was my bright and\nshining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to\nbecome anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn\u2019t\ngive him a Chance\u201d.\n\nDue to the corrupt system, Samaria Rice has a dead Child.\n\nHowever; he will always live in our hearts. Join us on November 26 to honor\nthe memory of Tamir and show support to his family. Remember Tamir Rice\n\n",

A number of victims\nand quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-\nknown case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was\nshot ten times and killed.

To protect and\nserve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!\n\nJoin us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between\nCharlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and\nCharged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.\n\nIt is not Clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards\nConfederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.\n\nNevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how |ibera| propaganda\ninfluences even on Southern people.\n\nThe names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be\nblurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American\nhistory; they fought for their beliefs and earned people\u2019s respect.\n\nIt is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect\nour history and fight against |ibera| brainwashing.\n\n",

And here are\n\nsome real Clinton decisions:\n\n\u2014Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had\n\nbeen exaggerated by Republicans.\n\u2014In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007\nsupplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans\u2019\n\nmedical care.\n-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20\n\nmillion for veterans\u2019 health care facilities.\n-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for \u201c$13 billion\nfor veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the\npoor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the\nissue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they\nneed so bad!\n\nHardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a\ndirect threat to the American veterans\u2019 society, but still practically no one\nraises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!\n\n",

Your vote should be\n\nprecious to y'all ous its your power to put another person in authority over\nyou, your freedom, your daily life and your safety.\n\nTo most people, it's about just going out to vote, if you did just that because\n\nyou want to, well done, if you didn't, aka #BOYCOTT just like me, you also\ngot your reasons.\n\nBUT, let those reasons be genuine! Let them be your reasons, not influenced\nupon or manipulated in any way.\n\nI'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but\n\nsimply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and\nthe interest of her kids, and voted consciously!\n\nI'm glad i Choose not to be a part of this whole system.\nIm proud to be woke\n\n",

According to ex-cop\u2018s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-\ndefense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,\nhitting Scott five times from behind.\n\nSlager\u2018s defense attorney\u2018s:\n\n\u201cThe doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically\nmotivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather\ntheir own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-\nsecond life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable\narmchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nThe shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken\nbrake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager\u2018s\ndashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him\nabout documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott\njumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a\nbystander\u2018s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.\n\nWe\u2018ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead\nblack bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none\nof them found guilty. That\u2018s why today it\u2018s important to send a message to\nother police officers that if they do this, it\u2018s harsh penalty to pay.\n\n",

Two months\nbefore his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two\nsons.\n\nJoshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of\nhis cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in\nIndianapolis at the age of 26.\n\nBeal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what\nauthorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-\nduty firefighter.\n\nThe relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest\nMemorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.\n\nSuddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old\nsister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her\noff \u2014 who she believed was a Chicago police officer \u2014 stopped and got out of\ntheir cars.\n\nAt some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a\ngun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.\n\nShe said the man got inside his car but exited again and \u201che just started\nshooting,\u201d hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his\ngun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal\nlegally owned the gun and did not fire it.\n\nBoxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began\nshooting him.\n\n\u201cI was hoping my brother wasn\u2019t dead,\u201d said Boxley.\n\nBeal\u2019s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2\u2014year-\nold, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.\n\n\u201cThis is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They\nhave no consideration for life,\u201d - Tiffaney Boxley.\n\nYet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will\nsay, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own\ndeath, armed or unarmed.\n\n#joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutCher #westandtogether\n#blacklivesmatter #unite4justice\n\n",

But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the\nnational anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating\nto the Black Youth Project 100.\n\nKaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward\n\u201cChapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to\nBuild Black Futures\u201d which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all\nBlack people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States\nof America.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what\nare ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those\ncommunities,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there\nis always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don\u2018t really care\nabout haters.\n\nGoodjob, Colin.\n",

He became enamored with the legal\nprofession and went to law school right after his parole.\n\nHe finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after\nwaiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,\nManville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented\nvarious inmates and prison guards in Civil cases.

After experiencing\nmany rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land\na job at Caesar\u2019s Palace.

Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But\n\nenemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always\nwas a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be\n\nfollowed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need\nof swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would\nbe exposed to, and of their need of protection.\n\nAnd we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you\nhave to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.\n\n",

Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in\nApril 2014.\n\nThe ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned\nbraids and twists amidst the criticism.\n\nSome of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.\nMoreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks\ncaused a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\nThe ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until\nJanuary 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.\nNow the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-\ninch wide.\n\nWell, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have\ndifferent hair texture.\n\n",

The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next\nyear the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.\nOne of co-founders said \u201cWe don\u2019t define profit in terms of money. The profit\nis the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.\u201d\nDrum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,\nsomething beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of\nthe shop: the drum is for \u201ccommunications within the diaspora,\u201d and the\nspear symbolizes \u201cwhatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the\npeople.\u201d\n\nThe best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the\nAutobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice.\n\nThis bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.\nDrum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a \"free\nspaces\" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital\nissues.

As we all know, CPS has been\nstruggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to\nwhere we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the\ncommunity as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to\nimprove our Chicago...\n\nAll of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free\nconcerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you\ncare. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility\naway from artists, but it hasn\u2019t Changed you...\n\nWe thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others\nhave put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored\nand as though we don\u2019t have enough support from bigger influences like you.\nBeing born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many\nstereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent\nviolence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that\nsomeone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You\nand your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be\nsuccessful, still be self-made...\n\nOnce again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we\nknow and love, Chicago.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAlex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt\n\nLake View High School Students\n\nChicago, Illinois\"\n\nIt's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young\npeople don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who\ncares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.\nIt should work.\n\nAs an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn\u2019t forget\nwho made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people\u2019s love.\nThat\u2019s cool that this love goes back and forth!\n\nWe need more of these positive black people on the media, because some\npeople forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day\ndifferent race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.\n\n#blackexcellence #blackperfeotion #blackbeauty #blackbusiness\n#africanamerioan #blackoommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america\n#usa #blackscience #education #diversity #Chancetherapper #Chicago #music\n#hiphop #rap\n\n",

If you want to stress that you use something you taken from\nanother culture it's one thing.

COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!\n\nDisturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in\nCharlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!\n\nThis man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the\nunidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the\nwoman tell Lim, \u201cCheck my bag. I\u2019m telling you I don\u2019t have anything.\u201d And\nwhy did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?\n\nCorine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded\nthat Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be\nnot only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black\npeople were treated disrespectfully! We don\u2019t believe apologies, especially\nwhen we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!\n\n",

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER\nVIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP\n\nTwo Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage\nof the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college\nstudent during a traffic stop.\n\nAccording to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over\nnear Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When\ncops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised\nbefore one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the\nsecond cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.\n\nThe 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach\nhim. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn\u2018t have\nanything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the\nincident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and\nClaimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted\narrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.\n\nThis incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law\nenforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation\nis not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they\nadmit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO\nGEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VID...\n\n",

The second coalition\nstrike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more Civilians. Just to make it\nClear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government\nagencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this\nis more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development\nprograms, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,\nEducation, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in\ntheir budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.\nHowever, terrorists weren\u2019t destroyed in \u201930 days\u2019 and it seems like they\nwon\u2019t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will\ndo it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war \u2018for freedom\u2019, it\u2019s\nanother example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood\nmoney is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict\ncan lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.\n\n",

I\nreally want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked\npoliticians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.\n\nHere\u2019s what Ron Paul thinks about it: \u201cBy the end of this month, Defense\nSecretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will\ndeliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,\nIraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send\nhis national security team back to the drawing board \u2014 or replace them. There\nis no way another \u201csurge\u201d in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)\nputs America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will\nsucceed any better than it did the last time.\u201d\n\nSyria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and\nwhy the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We\u2019ve started the whole Afghanistan\nthing to beat the Soviets, and no there\u2019s no Soviet Union on the world map,\nand all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian\nstudents.\n\n",

Our military\npresence in Syria now doesn\u2019t serve American interests. Our soldiers are\nthere to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for\nAmericans. And that\u2019s why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly\nopposite to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d concept.\n\nI believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and\nweeks after weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency there are no Changes in that\ndirection. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and\ntoday this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis\nwant to use Trump\u2019s influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli\nsovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he\u2019s trying make a deal out of it,\nbut there\u2019s one important thing here: under no Circumstances can our\nsoldiers\u2019 lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential\ncampaign Trump said \u201clet\u2019s bring back our soldiers home\u201d, and now it\u2019s\nreally time to do it. This is not our war.\n\n",

These videos and instances have become so common\nthat people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were\nwondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,\nkarma's coming back for blue pigs!\n\nA shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police\nofficers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two\nofficers for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two\nschool police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza\nshop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of\npolice do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y\nnothing without using their guns.\n\nCops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their\nown laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and\nelectrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing theirjob.\" All those things and\nmore are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my\nrights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.\n\nLook around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine\nabout it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is\nwhy cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our\nancestors did it for centuries.\n\nTake out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.\n",

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in\na public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense\naltercation with a student.\n\nAccording to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,\nBrian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.\n\nThe student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a\nbrief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.\n\nI don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more\nthen a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever\nhappened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an\nofficer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide\nsomething and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not\ndestruction of evidence a crime?\n\nWhat do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below.\n",

At the same time, this proposal, called \"A\nNew Foundation for American Greatness\", includes a boost in military\nspending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico.\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of\naffordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our\nfocus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get\nmore money for their wars, and they don\u2019t mind it if average Americans live in\npoverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our\nDepartment of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the\nnext eight countries combined, isn\u2019t it enough? Here is what Senate Minority\nLeader Chuck Schumer said: \"Based on what we know about this budget, the\ngood news -- the only good news -- is that it\u2019s likely to be roundly rejected by\nmembers of both parties here in the Senate -- just as the last budget was\"\n\n",

Not a small sum, it\u2019s roughly equal to the entire annual military budget\nof France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany,\nand Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of\n2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For\nexample, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in\nthe EPA\u2019s budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it\u2019s\na great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high-\npowerful warmongers in our government.

They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill\ninnocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!\n\n",
