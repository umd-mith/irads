I opted out of the elections and i had many Black people all up in my case,
telling me how i was wrong and how i needed to make my vote count for Mrs.
Clinton, all just to make sure Trump doesn't become president.

Well now all i want to say is get over Trump and Clinton, they are rich white
people, the elite who were born into and are a part of the system.

I dream of liberation, not staying a slave under Hillary or Trump, so forget

taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let’s remind them

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.

We’re coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American Civil rights leaders. Don’t forget to bring
your Children with you, because it’s important for them to know where they
come from and their rich history.

Join us on January 15! Let’s keep the dream alive! Martin Luther King Jr.

not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,36295,6656,2016-11-03T08:11:51-07:00,2016-11-10T07:11:51-08:00,500.00,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial
discrimination.

By recalling King’s vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive
and just community that does not retreat from diversity but draws strength
from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a
deepening political divisions in the country, King’s words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.

We’re coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American Civil rights leaders. Don’t forget to bring
your Children with you, because it’s important for them to know where they

spent his public career working toward ending segregation and fighting racial
discrimination.

By recalling King’s vision we can have opportunities to build a more inclusive
and just community that does not retreat from diversity but draws strength
from it. In the face of violence directed at minority communities and in a
deepening political divisions in the country, King’s words and philosophy are
perhaps more critical for us today than at any point in the recent past.

We’re coming together on January 15 to celebrate the life and achievements
one of the most influential American Civil rights leaders. Don’t forget to bring
your Children with you, because it’s important for them to know where they
come from and their rich history.

Join us on January 15! Let’s keep the dream alive! Martin Luther King Jr.

won't Check for your own people, seek help not more approval.
I'm not saying you should ever Check for people outside of your culture, I am
saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your

love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just
love yourself and heal your illness. ?

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Stories like the one of Jamycheal Mitchell, the 24-year-old young man who
was found dead in his jail cell on August 19, are particularly hard to hear.
What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to
death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell, who had a severe mental illness had
been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.

Ajudge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been
transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there
wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a
mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to
eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health
crisis.

The Supreme Court on Monday evening denied a Kentucky Clerk’s request to
keep enforcing her “no marriage licenses” policy — an attempt to avoid
issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples — while she appeals the trial
court’s preliminary ruling.

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to Choose whether to issue marriage
licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying
a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled

off to jail.

For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable.
She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she’s
screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite!

And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her
religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's
her role only to enact it!

Funny how all these ""Christians"" are preaching and practicing all this hate,
eh?

If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, ""What the hell
is wrong with you people!""

the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I
think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and
some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has
banned all flags and banners, including the US. flag -- and so on. The same

percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or
more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to
support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,1813,268,2015-09-10T03:48:38-07:00,2015-09-11T03:48:37-07:00,395.65,RUB,,,People who like Being Patriotic|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few
minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom
called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I
remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took
responsibility for the attacks.

And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11?

177,,Know your rights and your freedom,"Know your rights and your freedom

The murders of Michael Brown, Tryvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Eric Gartner
and other black victims have dramatized depth of racism in America society.
They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that
they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and
has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday
racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government
along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of
force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression.

Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is
Challenging, but it‘s worth discrimination and unfairness black Civilians face
everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon
you have against police abuse and brutality.

The most famous Civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for
their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African-
Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa
Parks Changed our lives forever.

But what Changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater
equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you
ever protested in Civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black
Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression?

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church.

174,,Innocent Bystanders Could Face Criminal …,"Innocent Bystanders Could Face Criminal Charges for Not Jumping in to Help
Officer Make Arrest

Residents of Huntsville, Alabama who declined to intervene to help a police
officer subdue a suspect could face criminal prosecution under a state statute
requiring them to assist an officer in trouble. Had the situation been reversed,
however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for
declining to aid a Citizen under assault by a suspect.

A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident,
allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

Autistic Teen Unconscious

During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line’s Lexington Parkway Station.

The teen suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.

Abrams non-compliance wasn’t done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Abrams’ autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything

More than twenty protesters organized by the Mass Action Against Police
Brutality group are calling for a further investigation into videotaped incident
that took place in Washington Street in Roslindale. Nearly three-minute
videotape posted to Youtube shows Boston Police officer earlier this month
Choking an 18-year-old Elvin Vargas and attempting to put him in a cruiser
after he was arrested on August 16.

Have you noticed than excessive force by police is disproportionate on people
of color? When the government, law enforcement, the criminal justice system
will treat all communities with dignity? How long should we complain about

It’s respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart
people. And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals.

The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he
doesn’t want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but
criminals don’t know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase
crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly
state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate.

The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as
usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in

wrong places.

In Mississippi

One of the last things that Jonathan Sanders, an unarmed black man,
reportedly said before he died was, “Let me go. I can’t breathe.” On
Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall,
Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a
flashlight before killing him in view of his family members.

Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a
flashlight, Sander’s attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate.
Parrish |ater Clarified that those allegations came from family members who
witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced “some kind of

asphyxiation” during the altercation.
Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two Children.

The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe,"" the last words of
Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe, let me go"". Biting irony, isn't it?

Caitlyn accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards.

Caitlyn is amazing! It was her first public appearance since announcing her
decision to transition.

And her speech brought me to tears. It was very touching and thought
provoking.

She spoke about her own personal experience so far as a transgender
woman. But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a
thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the
larger transgender community.

In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is
an American hero of a great courage. Because it takes courage to stand up
and do everything she has done and is doing.

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have
singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred
enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking
“traditional marriage” or infringing on their religious liberty.

Yet in the months surrounding the recent US. Supreme Court decision to
legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have

become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a
group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians,

especially those who support marriage equality.

caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,

religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new
Claim about how these bakers’ “free speech” is under attack and how

they’re thus the real victims.

a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do

Monday morning, July 20, the US flag continued to fly at the top of the White

a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at haIf-staff upon
the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or
her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By
contrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn’t yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen
soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as
meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist
attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then
decided to kill in the name of Allah.

ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do

not even bother to learn English, because it’s enough to speak Spanish, has

A divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a
municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved
in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a City park last November.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable
cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank
Garmback, to face Charges in the shooting.

Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a City recreation
center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun.
Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots
pellets, died the next day.

By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've
been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they
arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use
excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

for Kelvin Sewell, the community’s first black police Chief.

On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of

voice their outrage to the Pooomoke City Council with posters that read ""We

Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that
he experienced in school and on the streets.

North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was
trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was
told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat
to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her Children would get arrested.

What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police,
improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.
That‘s why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black
men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in

plague black women every day.

fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.”

Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all
the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair
sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are
being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for

Passing the “First Amendment Defense Act” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT oonservatives’ top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It’s part of the National
Organization for Marriage’s post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential
candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily.
Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and

too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more

Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and

against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races.

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the
Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the
family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their
own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the
driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family.

“He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a
gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn’t worth anything now,”
Mark Wilson said.

When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it’s amoral, it is
beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery
was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don’t want to understand that
slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a
flag of England or France.

Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and
monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at
Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even
demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political
correctness because George Washington owned slaves.

Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans
should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not Clear. If
somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to
eliminate the party.

A teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven
years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death.

This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.

His mother said that she respected the police and that her son “shouldn’t
have had the gun.” But from what witnesses have told her, she said, “They
didn’t have to shoot him down like that.”

One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.

When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a

A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for

Alzheimer’s disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the
process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling

payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher.

Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had
huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today

a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate
fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low
wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the US. economy.
Those who work illegaly don’t pay taxes that are an important part of state

budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions
increases crime rates.

One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been
discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against
injustice and inequality!

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service.
Let’s meet the big player in repealing the ban.

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary
among his fellow Army soldiers.
But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first

openly trans soldier of the US Army.

He’s astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (Check out his
muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee,
he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he
gets giddy talking about both video games and shopping wood in Alaska.

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has
been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army
paperwork, he is identified as a woman.

But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for
the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

Under the City’s new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last
week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The
system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department,
the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or
disorderly conduct.

The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit
with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what
should we do?

The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be Changed. The worse, it
is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep
people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a
business.

The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government
will start to sell indulgences soon.

Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative
solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and
potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail!

Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives
go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other
Presidents administrations were brought to justice.

records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too
corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary Citizens. On
the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That’s why he spoke
to issues of poverty, oppression and racism.

Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money,
drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government’s attitude
towards Blacks. But let’s remember Tupac and his ability to question the

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.

Why the symbol of the pro-slavery rebellion is still flying on the ground of
South Carolina? Why the symbol of white supremacy is still flying on the
South Carolina statehouse in Columbia? Why the flag that represents the
murder of blacks was not removed from the national statehouse?

The confederate flag represents terrorism, reminding us about the slavery
time, racism and people that were murdered in a hate-crime. Today, we ask
to remove this symbol of racism that flies 120 miles away from the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.

Yes, we must wipe off every single symbol of racism from the United States of
America including the confederate flag, KKK and other racist organizations.
We must give new names to the streets which were named after racist
political figures and slave traders. We must remove monuments dedicated to
Andrew Jackson, Robert Lee, Benjamin Huger, James Longstreet who owned
slaves on their farms.

How can we ever expect to get the racist symbols removed until we show
ourselves to be men the same as any other race of men?",https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,412,23,2015-06-23T07:42:57-07:00,2015-06-24T07:42:56-07:00,174.75,RUB,"Baltimore Maryland|Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri|Cleveland Ohio",,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country? What if the Church is not a safe place anymore?

The president of a local NAACP Chapter in Spokane, Washington is under
investigation after her parents publicly accused her of lying being African
American. Both parents of Rachel Dolezal are white. Rachel Dolezal also
serves as the Chair of Spokane's Office of Police Ombudsman Commission
and is an adjunct professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington
University. Dolezal falsely identified herself as African-American in order to be
appointed as a Chair. Dolezal's parents paid attention to the official
documents, including a birth certificate, confirming that Rachel is part
Swedish, Czech, and German with ""traces"" of Native American heritage.

We see, how whites are trying to gain control over traditionally black
organization that protects the rights and interests of the black community. In
the Dolezal’s case it is unlikely it was a mistake or personally motivated
fraud. Simply she was given a task to join the association of black community
in order to control it and hold the interests of white majority.

We need a deep inspection of Rachel Dolezal’s activities while she was a
president of the local branch of the Association of black people! In order not to
repeat similar cases in future we need a careful control of all appointments by
black community! As it is, there is a dominance of whites in police

going to just go ahead and say it... .the blacks are the ones causing the
problems and this ‘racial tension. I guess that’s what happens when you

What is the most important thing the government must to do this year in order
our country to live in peace?

The criminal justice system is very important institution where law
enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed
perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if
American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a
renewed sense ofjustice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main
Challenge of the criminal justice system?

Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of
America. Consequently, the victim‘s skin color plays a crucial role in deciding
what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to
be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if
the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots,
then they must think about the living standards of black population that is
several times below the living standards of white people in America. In
addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black
population by revising the hiring policy for black AmericansTherefore, if we
want a life‘s balance, the government have to reconsider all these things,
because Black Americans lives matter.",https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,1012,83,2015-06-23T07:43:35-07:00,2015-06-24T07:43:35-07:00,261.08,RUB,"Baltimore Maryland|Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri|Cleveland Ohio",,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray
likely died from a single ""high-energy injury"" sustained as he rode shackled in
the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy
report obtained by the Baltimore Sun.

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up
during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown
against the van wall when the vehicle Changed direction. Like really? When
police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a
severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so.
It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something?

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a
deeply racist country?

Vallum. Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not
Clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom

Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was
transgender.

Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth
transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National
Coalition of Ahti-Violence Programs’ report hate-motivated violence against
transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a
transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in
1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows
lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call

LITTLE BLACK BOY

The shocking video shows a Central Texas Child trying to get up from a bean
bag Chair in his Classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vahn pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small Child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: “Tell me no. When | tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.”

After the Burleson County Sheriff‘s Office launched an investigation, a
“behavior specialist” who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child
should be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,0,0,2016-10-20T07:56:03-07:00,2016-10-21T07:56:02-07:00,0.00,,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-American history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic
disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William
Evans.

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,
of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October
12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to
drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire
themselves.

This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is
too far from being OVER. It’s only coming and the consequences will be
destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against oops, will become the
President of the United States.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of
every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American
national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist
movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse
racism, against those who want to destroy America!

the police from terrorists.",https://www.facebook.oom/Being-PatriotiC-1601685693432389/,3362,761,2016-10-14T08:24:29-07:00,2016-10-15T08:24:28-07:00,500.00,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Young people continue to take a knee during a national anthem to protest
police brutality and racial injustice in America. However, most of these
athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10,
after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the
Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,
the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive
board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season

centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but
they are wrong. We won’t put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does
not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it
mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some
outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a
victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.
We are free citizens of Texas and we’ve had enough of this Cheap show on
the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and
gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but
not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher
taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist
attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let’s remind them
what Texas is made of and show that we’re ready to SECEDE!

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always

was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

you don’t have a sword, sell your Cloak and buy one.”
— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.",https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-1195795607160174/,0,0,2016-10-17T02:14:28-07:00,2016-10-13T03:18:15-07:00,0.00,,,,,Amenity|Jesus Daily,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are
some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had
been exaggerated by Republicans.

—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

around the nation have mobilized every year since 1996 for a National Day of
Protest to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a
Generation.

Here in Charlotte, this problem appears especially hard. A number of victims
and quantity of cases, where justice wasn't served - horrifies. The most well-
known case is shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man who was
shot ten times and killed. Or situation with Daniel Kevin Harris, a deaf man,
who just couldn't explain a thing, before he was shot.

We need to use our right to protest to demand the authorities and police
representatives, to do, the thing they are supposed to do! To protect and
serve! Not to kill, damage and cripple!

Join us on October 22, in Charlotte, 600 East Trade Street, just between
Charlotte City hall and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. National
Day of Protest.

shot him within two seconds of arriving on the scene. A grand jury decided not
indict the killer.

Tamir’s mother said she is “mad as hell” with the grand jury’s decision of
declaring the officer not guilty. She went on to say, “He was my bright and
shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to

become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t
give him a Chance”.

shining star. He was full of light and laughter. Tamir had the potential to
become anything in the World, but Officer Loehmann and Garmback didn’t

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the Change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to Close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.

50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.

Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has

An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only
recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his
death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter.

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports
that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the
lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the
dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom,
Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when
told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer
Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation
broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of
Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

And now there are three main points that you should think of:

1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo
State University. Never was involved in criminal activities.

2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and
was working under the supervision of a training officer.

3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one

to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want
our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes

doomed to disappointment?",https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,290,86,2015-08-10T07:36:40-07:00,2015-08-11T07:36:39-07:00,44.54,RUB,,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson|St. Louis Missouri; Cleveland Ohio,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

used on black Americans.

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody
or bullets in your Chest.

Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these
issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent.
Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be
targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers
the rights of black community.

Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black
men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America
would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the
domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.",https://www.facebook.com/BlaCk-Matters-1579673598947501/,3218,408,2015-08-21T07:45:31-07:00,2015-08-26T09:00:00-07:00,483.15,RUB,,Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson|St. Louis Missouri; Cleveland Ohio,People who like Black Matters|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Mary McLeod Bethune was the Civil rights activist and an educator who found
the National Council of Negro Women in 1935. Being one of the 17 Children of
former slaves she was the first and the only Child to go to African-Amerioan
school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls
because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In
addition, Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For
instance, she was the president of the Florida Chapter of the National
Association of Colored Women. Moreover, in 1935 Mary Bethune became an
advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started
her Civil rights organization, the National Council of Negro Women.

The great educator and Civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune

minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled
over? What if they do something they don‘t supposed to be doing? It is not
always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it‘s a reality. What if

police officers will automatically assume that your Child is criminal because of
how him or her looks.

Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the
way they look. That‘s why it‘s important to instruct our Children how to react
when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows
your Child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store.

His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: “As he is
remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the
countless moments ofjoy and laughter he gave to millions.”

Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with
his trademark playfulness.

While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about
discussing the sexuality of his pet pug.

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very
modern.”

When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro-
LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude

Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story -

specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.

""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of
the most recognizable, iconic Characters in the world to be among the first to
step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not
just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.""

Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as
supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark

milestone in LBGTQ rights history.

Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to
Change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her
superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-)

We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military

was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search
warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the
suspect four times were about seven years on the force.

on, nine people were arrested on Charges of resisting arrest. The protesters
said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if

do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that
the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters
who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the City and the
government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in
America instead of suspecting every single black men?

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will launch an investigation
into to the death of one of the five black women who died in an American jail
over a two-week span. Raynette Tumer who was the mother of eight Children
died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting
some crab legs from a grocery store. Due to her bad health history she was
taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to

help.

According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to
Check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one Checked Tumer‘s cell for
more than two hours.

A total of five African-Amerioan women have been found dead in police
custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor Charges and
still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra
Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones
from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell
after being arrested by police officers.

Oakland police officers fatally shot a man suspected in alleged carjaoking
attempt in Downtown Oakland Wednesday night. Is it a race war?

Yesterday night, a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to
shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence
was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day.

According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 pm. in the area
of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard, Oakland police officers spotted a
vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The
pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King
Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The
suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital.

Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers?

How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is
the government speaking about the existence of racism in America?

Do you know the best way to ruin your career in the US? Follow the rules and
the ""miracle"" won't be late in arriving.

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed
black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the
relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka ""Bad
cop, who killed innocent black Child"" tried to go back to police work but was
turned down because he's too big a liability.

In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, ""It's too hot an issue,
so it makes me unemployable.""

So what does the situation mean to America?

Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had
the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent.
Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed
him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He
must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how
upside-down society has become.

I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will
surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send
teachers to jail for teaching?

Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots
turned society against an innocent man.

parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

culture of gun violence and racism

35-mile trek to Washington has started this Sunday evening in order to bring
more attention to widespread violence in different Cities across America. The
founder of the group Munir Bahar said that the march will last 20 hours in a
memory of more than 200 people who have been killed in Baltimore this year.
The 300 Men March will highlight the racism and violence across the country.

What‘s wrong with our society? Police kill unarmed Citizens, we kill each
other. What example we will be setting for the future generations? How are
we going to break the cycle of violence? Are there any Chances to overcome

Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King has Claimed for years that he is
biracial, being born to a white mother and a black father. But recently
uncovered records Claim he misled the public about his race, and that he is in
fact a white man pretending to be black.

King’s race would not be under scrutiny if it was not an essential component
of his career, education and social status. In addition to getting a full-ride
scholarship that is exclusively for black men, King has the position of “Justice
Columnist” at progressive news website Daily Kos and enjoys a
169,000-strong follower count on Twitter, most of whom are a result of his
activism following the death of Mike Brown in Ferguson.

background: Are you black? Instead, he said, “If you have known me from
when l was in elementary school at Huntertown Elementary until now, you’ve
known me as black or bi-racial.”

wounding more than a dozen others in a precision assault. Hours later, two
terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at
large.

It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably
linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the
administration — accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National
security.

It’s tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately,
today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer
terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to Change our way of life.
We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms.

May 16 marked the sixth anniversary of the brutal slaying of 7-year-old Aiyana
Stanley-Jones by Detroit Police Officer Joe Weekley. She was shot by the
cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still
employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was Charged with involuntary
manslaughter and two lesser Charges in her death, but the case was dropped

in January 2015.

Justice hasn’t been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.

We’re planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal
Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police
violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much
attention as possible to the lack ofjustice for the families of those who lost
their beloved ones at the hands of the police.

I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a
Choice, so it can be “cured”. Just like Ben Carson thinks that you’re Choosing

to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of

If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can‘t see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn‘t for us here before the elections, remember? If these

HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,54,6,2016-04-07T07:44:35-07:00,2016-04-08T07:44:34-07:00,51.87,RUB,,,People who like Blacktivist|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Blacktivist,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America",https://www.facebook.com/MuslimAmerica/,19055,2445,2016-03-18T07:59:40-07:00,2016-03-21T07:59:39-07:00,5500.00,RUB,,,,Humans of New York,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices P(1)0003699

endorsement of Trump. They Claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and
“white supremacists”. The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist
and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared “I don’t know
anything about David Duke... You’re asking me a question that I’m supposed
to be talking people I know nothing about.”

However, “for some reasons” the same mass media in their revelation
campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton’s ties to Robert Byrd, a former
KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of “surpassing eloquence and
nobility”. In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying “It is
almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate
can’t be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show
her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.
Isn’t that a little hypocritical?",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,1775,334,2016-03-18T07:33:45-07:00,2016-03-21T07:33:45-07:00,351.61,RUB,,,People who like Being Patriotic|Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around

officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he
was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

leader is one of them. Obama has betrayed America and now he is just
executing orders of his bosses.

Obama was always a mere pawn in the hands of Arabian Sheikhs. His latest
orders are just proving it. All these refugees, which we are about to take in,

are soldiers with one simple goal. They are going to try to terrorize the nation
until it agrees to convert.

To win this war we need to gather our forces and elect a leader, who loves
America as much as we do and is willing to do everything it takes to protect it.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,
it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their
eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff’s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work, they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Ha|| received a “need improvement rating,” his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.

The US. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits

Challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their

the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver’s

Reports indicate that he has just put forth a $1.3 billion budget proposal, to be
distributed among 75,000 minors that are expected to cross into the United
States this year from Central America.

That breaks down to about $17,613 a ChiId—an amount that is significantly
higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According
to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA
retirement benefit for legal Citizens is roughly $14,772.

As if that weren’t enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for
refugees.

This just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American
Citizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned moneyjust give it to
people who deserve it the least. I guess Veterans don‘t need a better social

security.

Recently released video shows the moment officers shot 24-year-old Brandon
Bethea with a stun gun as he was in a jail cell.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that’s why he was hit with
a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.
FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the
trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the
officers involved in Bethea's death.

There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20
minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they
attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in

finished a Science Course at Imperial College London University was and still
reigns as the smartest kid on planet earth, studied at the Oxford University at
the age of 6.

And yes, he was too advanced for his required school grade so that lead him
into being homeschooled. He excels in Math, Foreign Languages, History,
Philosophy, IT and Science.

Now tell me Black people are not magic!

After the critics complained about the Army‘s unfair burden on black women‘s

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,48,27,2017-02-14T06:46:19-08:00,2017-02-15T06:46:19-08:00,200.00,RUB,,,,Pan-Afrioanism|African-Amerioan Civil Rights Movement (1954—68)|African-Amerioan history|Black (Color),,,,,,,,English (UK)|English (US),,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the
Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise
and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and
how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

with his illustrations is As Big As God.

That’s what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck,
Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon’s mother believed in him.
Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with
your roots!

2476,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umd-mith/irads/master/site/images/2476.png,Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington D…,"Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran
members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

today, in 2017.

cops.
Sadly, those who blindly repeat that phrase remain irresponsibly oblivious to
the real problem of police abusing innocent people.
As a recent ACLU lawsuit shows, being innocent is no guarantee police won’t

kick in your door, strangle you, beat you, and force you to fill out a false
statement.

commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let’s hope it
will end now when Trump is in Charge.

A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in
Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for US.
Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from
the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish
and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa.

We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all.
Unfortunately that’s hardly possible because of the corruption in the
Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator
McCain, and that’s why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but
also getting involved into another regime Change venture and possibly
another oil war.

We’re fighting radical Islamists, but we’re also siding with Syrian opposition,
the very same radical Islamists, and there’s absolutely no guarantee that
these rebels won’t replace ISIS when it’s gone.

There’s only one Chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American
nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do
now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.",https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,5186,502,2017-05-18T07:14:21-07:00,2017-05-19T07:30:00-07:00,500.00,RUB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,0,0,2016-05-06T06:35:56-07:00,2016-05-09T06:35:55-07:00,0.00,,,,,Social justice|St. Louis,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

To be honest, I’m not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of
affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our
focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get
more money for their wars, and they don’t mind it if average Americans live in
poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our

a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.

Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.

then a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not

Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida
Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.
When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police
ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to Change.

VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don’t have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

Sincerely,

Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt

It's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

ATTENTION! COMMUNITY CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT!

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially

two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an

Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and

something for us they see us as strangers anyway, we will always be ""others""

Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!

In 1947, she became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in

Today, inspiring many young Black girls to become Chemists, Dr. Daly
researched the connection between high Cholesterol and heart disease.
Black excellence has a rich and powerful history.

nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to
education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to
confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from
another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks
and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird.
White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
Same goes to African Americans who copy white people. Know yourself! We
have beautiful culture and history!

accessory line! Gibbs produces at least 5 original ties each day! His mom
helps him. They called their company Classic Knot. Their customers are so
happy to wear these ties that Classic Knot is going to hire some extra
employees!

By the way this business is not an obstacle for school. Shelden's Classmates
even offer their help too!

""I teach him the sky is the limit from here. Dream big, think big, don't think
small or you'll always have small,"" said Shelden's mother Rhonda Woods and
she’s absolutely right! It’s so good that kids are thinking of pleasing other
people and supporting their families!

become a doctor. Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It
wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were
some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but
despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became
the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan

B.
Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving

OurSeres Successfully (GLOSS).
That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's
inspiring! And it's especially good that Hilton dedicated herself to teaching

others.

Women's Hall of Fame earlier this month. This is a huge step for a latino
woman in the US. She says: ""Diversity on the bench is so important because
the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.""

However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really
caring about us! Whether there are latinos or not, authorities will continue to
deport us from our indigenous land!",https://www.facebook.com/brownunitedfront/,2247,133,2017-03-14T07:37:53-07:00,2017-03-15T13:07:00-07:00,137.16,RUB,,,,Mexico|Latin hip hop|Chicano Movement|Hispanidad|Lowrider|Chicano rap|La Raza,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

Yes she still looks hot and cute and sexy and much more beautiful than a
million women of all races who put on so many make-up, tarnishing the
original melanin strength. No one is saying make-ups are bad.

Just saying that natural Melanin is more powerful than any other make-up
product!

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.

He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA’s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar’s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn’t gotten to Henderson’s head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can

Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter.
Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two
college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal
profession and went to law school right after his parole.

He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after
waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,
Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in Civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge
police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the
government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to Close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.

50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the Change, we must take
action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and Challenge

government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party
""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to Close
it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was
dissolved.

50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country
stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. lt spreads through all the country
like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We
need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that
can make Black Lives really matter.

American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to ""disrupt
the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the
intervention deprived aI-Qaida of a sanctuary. But aI-Qaida — even after its
leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US. commandos — has spawned cells
elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is
rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question
is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the
mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should
review his military strategy without delay.Joih us! Veterans USA ( @veterans

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will Change. Amen.",https://www.facebook.com/Dont-Shoot-1157233400960126/,0,0,2016-07-06T07:05:50-07:00,2016-05-09T06:35:55-07:00,0.00,,Louisiana,,,,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

1496,,Please take a moment to read my story!,"Please take a moment to read my story!

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that

Thursday night. It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton
Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,
Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of Chaos and
carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two Civilians. The
sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black US. military veteran of the Afghan war.
As he was captured, he Claimed he wanted to “kill white people”.

There’s no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There’s no
proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago
and the police can’t show anything to prove there was a link between Micah
X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us
time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».
The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is
a violent anti-government riot!

problems we face happen because we’ve stopped calling things by their
names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We’re
hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don’t
want to ‘offend’ someone.

And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence
is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent’s rallies
and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people
standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives
Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war

on cops will end and people running a conservative ra||y won’t be afraid to be
attacked by a hateful gang.

altercation with a student.

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.

I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. “It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that’s where the source of the
cocaine was,” special agent Tim Stone said.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in
a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense
altercation with a student.

According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim,
Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom.

The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a
brief Clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him.

I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more
then a bunch of bu||ies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever
happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an
officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide
something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not
destruction of evidence a crime?

gay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
if it’s evident. There’s a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, “Sworn officer of the court” is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it’s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be
filled.

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
accused of committing a felony.

Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
be filled.

federal court Challenge seeking to block a Mississippi law that lets Clerks Cite
religious beliefs to reouse themselves from issuing marriage licenses to same-
sex couples. The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the

separation of Church and state by favoring “certain narrow religious beliefs
that condemn same-sex couples who get married, condemn unmarried

people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people.”

Rodney Sumter Jr., 27 miraculously survived Pulse nightclub Orlando
shooting, being shot three times. But he’s still in a lot of pain.

his mother, said he is in intense pain and that it has been difficult for him to
get comfortable and is needing sedation and heavy pain medications.

Rodney was shot in the arms and back. He had surgery Monday to repair his
arms, but shrapnel was left in his back. He had another surgery Wednesday
night, family said.

Doctors said Rodney is running a fever and suspect he may have an
infection.

killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common
that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were
wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,
karma's coming back for blue pigs!

A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police
officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two
officers for seemingly no reason.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two
school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza
shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of
police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do |itera||y
nothing without using their guns.

Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their
own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with Chemical and
electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing theirjob."" All those things and
more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my
rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.

Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine
about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is
why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our
ancestors did it for centuries.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of
his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the
ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the
location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on

the passenger's side.

When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the
situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man
briefly lying unconscious on the ground.

The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows
that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be

option"". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than
an ""organized crime"" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers'
money!

Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like
Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that
abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged
feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries
that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary
has always been a ""defender"" of the minorities.

So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me.
What's your opinion on that point?",https://www.faoebook.com/Born-Liberal-522628564598423/,1938,222,2016-06-08T01:01:26-07:00,2016-06-09T01:01:24-07:00,500.00,RUB,,,,Bernie Sanders,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of

is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people

Muslim refugees, if she is president.

fatally shooting a mentally ill Black man in 2014 has gotten his job back? This
is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without
prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black
person’s life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the
second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired.
It is now absolutely Clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led
to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

we have had our Chance and we never profited out of it. We had a moment to
present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we
refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to
benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason.
He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is
the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great.
The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by
day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In
no time, “White Power” will be stronger than before.

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

police shooting of Philando Castile resulted in the arrest of 46 people outside
the governor’s mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Another arrest was carried
out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protesters were
arrested and Charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July
7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have
been embarking on demonstration outside the governor’s home but police
officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are
blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the
protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors
are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.
Even though the street was Cleared few days after July 18, some protesters
have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

We found old dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas

The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran
trooper, took Chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near
Houston.

Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and
show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was
already surrendering off his motorcycle.

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people’s
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn’t it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

“The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,” said
Chicago—based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said “ Power concedes nothing except by a demand”. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.

It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall. Organizers of the
Million Man March call forjustioe, standing against the police and for blacks,
Latinos and incarcerated.

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among
radical groups. Only black activists say “black lives matter”, forgetting the fact
thatjustice is when all lives matter.

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the
law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes
over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the
immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should
be imprisoned.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in
Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan’s
benevolent intentions.

This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim
communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent
news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal
Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on
American extremists to execute him.

There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he
should live here legally; he should not break the law. lt’s justice.",https://www.faoebook.com/patriototus,2499,229,2015-10-08T00:34:04-07:00,2015-10-09T00:34:04-07:00,1993.03,RUB,Washington,,,Independence|Patriotism,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices

316,,Why | March! #JusticeOrElse,"Why | March! #JusticeOrElse

20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and Children gathered on the
National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""

This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better
future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if

you don’t have a sword, sell your Cloak and buy one.”
— Luke 22:36

What does that mean? Jesus always stood for peace and non-violence. But

enemies often issued threats towards Him and His disciples. There's always
was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need
of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would
be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

And we, American Christians, should remember about it. Sometimes you
have to arm yourself to protect your loved ones and friends.",https://www.facebook.com/Army-of-Jesus-1195795607160174/,0,0,2017-01-10T02:20:28-08:00,2016-10-13T03:18:15-07:00,0.00,,,,,jesus love u|| Have Decided to Follow Jesus,,,,,,,,,,News Feed on desktop computers|News Feed on mobile devices
